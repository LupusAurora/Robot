This is a repo for a project i am working on with a friend.

We made a humanoid robot from scratch.
First we designed and 3D printed the parts, etched a circuit board and then assembled everything together.

We used commercial hobby-grade servo motors and other components.
Robot is powered by 2 18650 lithium batteries.
Movement is controlled by an Arduino Mega, which can communicate with a computer via USB cable or Bluetooth.
